## Wordkeeper Bot

<img src="images/wordkeeper.png?raw=true"/>

**What is it?** It is a game-style bot that is centric around the concept of... spamming. Every time you send a message, it must contain a reserved word that is set by other users in the server. If you send a message and it does not have the word, you get kicked. If you do send the word, your score goes up by 1. There are lots of commands for ways to remove people, create channels, and gamble all the score away if you chose to. It may seem like a solid waste of time; however it has been a great exploration of utilizing Javascript and Node.js in an environment that is exposed to a lot of people.
