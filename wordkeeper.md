## Wordkeeper Bot

<img src="images/wordkeeper.jpg?raw=true"/>

**What is it?** It's a game-style bot that is centric around the concept of... spamming. Everytime you send a message, it must contain a reserved word that is set by other users in the server. If you don't send it, you get kicked. If you do, your score goes up by 1. There are lots of commands for ways to remove people, create channels, and gamble all the score away if you chose to.
