## THIS MODEL HAS 41T IN IT. NOT "41". MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOURS.

This is a fix for the moving block on the electric recliner mechanism. This tutorial is only helpful for those who:

1. Are competent and willing to disassemble the broken piece
2. Are unwilling to spend $100 on a fully assembled (motor included) replacement
3. Are kind of handy
