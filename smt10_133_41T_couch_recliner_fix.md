# Broken Couch Recliner Assembly Moving Block Fix -- SMT10-04-133-226 (41T) Linear Actuator BySterling Motion Block Replacement

## THIS MODEL HAS 41T IN IT. NOT "41". MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOURS.

This is a fix for the moving block on the electric recliner mechanism. This tutorial is only helpful for those who:

1. Are competent and willing to disassemble the broken piece
2. Are unwilling to spend $100 on a fully assembled (motor included) replacement
3. Are kind of handy

To purchase the moving block, [I have it listed on Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/listing/4310178167/read-description-smt10-04-133-22641t).
