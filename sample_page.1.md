## My Projects

**Discord Reverse Image Seach Bot:** This bot served as a starting point for finding the sources of images that could be uploaded via the discord chat application. It utilized a custom google image search api, and supported either links and direct uploaded photos in any resolution. If a perfect match was found on a public sourced website, it would be given, otherwise a visually similiar result was passed back to the user. 

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
