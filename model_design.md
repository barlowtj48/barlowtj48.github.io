# Electric Reclining Couch Fixes

[Contact Me](mailto:contact@barlowfabrication.com)

**What is it?**

I have been designing and selling replacement blocks for broken electric recliners. It came up when I fixed one for my parents, and ever since then I have been working with folks with broken recliners to have them sent in and I design the fix, and send them back. After they confirm for me that everything is good to go, I list them on Etsy for others to purchase. This is a great way to save money and keep these assemblies out of the landfill. It is a relatively simple fix, just a bit of disassembly and reassembly.

**My Couch Has Issues and You Don't Have It Listed**

You're in the right place. I am always looking to expand the list of models I can fix. If you have a broken couch, please reach out to me and we can work together to get it fixed. If you are the first person to reach out to me about a specific model, I will cover the cost of shipping for you to send it to me, and I will design the fix for free and send it back to you. In my mind, this is a win-win. You get your couch fixed for free, and I get to add another model to my list of fixes.

**How Do I Purchase?**
If you have a model that I have already designed a fix for, you can purchase it on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/BarlowFabrication). If you have a model that is not listed, please reach out to me via email. My email is [contact@barlowfabrication.com](mailto:contact@barlowfabrication.com)

**I am International, are these still for sale?**
Through Etsy, I am able to ship anywhere. Due to the shipping configuration though, I may not have your country listed. Reach out to me via email or through Etsy and I will add your country to the list. International shipping is flat $10 extra.
