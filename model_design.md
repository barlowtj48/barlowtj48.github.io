## 3D Printing and Model Designing

**What do I make?:** In my past semesters working, I gained some experience with 3D modeling, especially in Siemens NX. With this, I went through some iterative design process and made something functional for my car. It has a cool exhaust muffler cutout wireless remote, but it takes up a cupholder and therefore space I'd like to have. After some designing to match the contour of the cupholder itself, I designed it to fit onto the outside of it. Works like a charm, and gets used daily without problem. Definitely some improvements to be made, but those will come with better access to a 3D printer.
