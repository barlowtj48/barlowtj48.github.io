**What do I make?:** This channel is where I like to upload video projects, most frequently music projects where I make songs and document how I go about doing it. These are complemented by synchronized subtitles, as well as some visual effects that match up with the music. I really enjoy making these videos, and have been lucky enough to have been viewed more than a quarter of a million times!

I also upload all of the songs I make to [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/barlowtj)
