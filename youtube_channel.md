**What do I make?:** This channel is where I like to upload video projects, most frequently music projects where I make songs and document how I go about doing it. These are complemented by synchronized subtitles, as well as some visual effects that match up with the music. If you're interested feel free to check it out on [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/c/thomasbarlow)
