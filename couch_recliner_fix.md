# Broken Couch Recliner Moving Block Fix -- Mulin Electric Equipment Model: ML8-145

This is a fix for the moving block on the electric recliner mechanism. This tutorial is only helpful for those who:

1. Are competent and willing to disassemble the broken piece
2. Are unwilling to spend $75 on a fully assembled (motor included) replacement
3. Are kind of handy

To purchase the moving block, [I have it listed on Etsy](https://barlowfabrication.etsy.com/listing/1695830529).
