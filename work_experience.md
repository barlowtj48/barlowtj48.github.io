## My Work Experience

**Siemens Software:** I've been a co-op student software engineer at Siemens Sofware since the Summer of 2017, working on a large variety of different projects and one 3 different teams over the span of 4 semesters. 

### 1. Spring 2019 Semester

### 2. Summer 2018 Semester

### 3. Fall 2017 Semester

### 4. Summer 2017 Semester

During my first semester working on co-op, I started out working on a team with 6 other co-op students on a web automation testing suite. This included recording tests, playing back and recording any changes that occured that were unexpected relative to when the test was recorded. Analytics for regressions could be analyzed to determine problems and reduce man hours spent testing and verifying functionality. 

**Technical skills used**: Java, Regular Expressions, VBA, Javascript
