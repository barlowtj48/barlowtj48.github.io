## Reverse Image Search Discord Bot

**Usage:** This bot served as a starting point for finding the sources of images that could be uploaded via the discord chat application. It utilized a custom google image search api, and supported either links and direct uploaded photos in any resolution. If a perfect match was found on a public sourced website, it would be given, otherwise a visually similiar result was passed back to the user.
